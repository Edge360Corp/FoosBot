Quick and dirty scorebot, stats display

Fashioned after those websites that give live game information without letting you
watch or see the game

Missing alot of formatting, infact needs either foundation, bootstrap, or angular seeds
Also needs a backend for stats storing and i've conceptualized a nifty directive that
needs to take the given players and come up with stats in appropriate context
